## What is OCR?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an image of text into a machine-readable text format.

## How to install more OCR languages?

1. In Windows, open the "Language settings" window (you can search for it by pressing the <kbd>Win</kbd> key).
2. In the "Preferred languages" section, press the "Add a language" button.
3. Choose a language that you would like to install, and press the "Next" button.
4. Uncheck all "Optional language features" as we don't need any of them for OCR to work.
5. Make sure that under "Required language features" it lists "Optical character recognition"; if it's not listed there, then your language doesn't support this feature. Press the "Install" button.
6. Wait for Windows to install the language you chose in the background.
7. After the language is installed, ShareX will include it in the language drop-down menu the next time the OCR window is opened.
