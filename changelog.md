* Google has forced us to use a more restrictive [API scope (/auth/drive.file)](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth#drive-scopes) for [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), which does not allow us to see files or folders anymore. Because of this, we cannot provide folder listing and selection support anymore.
    * However, there is a workaround. You can navigate to the Google Drive website in your browser, open the folder you want to upload to, and then copy the folder ID from the browser's address bar to "Folder ID" textbox.

## [ShareX 13.3.0](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases/tag/v13.3.0) - 2020-10-29 {#v13.3.0}

**[Action Required] Important announcement for Windows 7 users:**

We updated .NET Framework version to 4.7.2 in the previous ShareX update. [Microsoft recommends that a specific TLS version should not be hardcoded](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls) so that way the latest supported TLS protocols by the operating system can be used automatically. That is what we did too but then after our previous ShareX release we noticed even though Windows 7 supports TLS 1.2, it was still not using the latest version automatically and needed to hardcode TLS 1.2 in our code to support it. Therefore, due to the lack of TLS 1.2 support **auto updater of ShareX is broken for Windows 7 users** and ShareX must be updated manually from [ShareX web site](https://getsharex.com/downloads) or you can download [dev build inside ShareX app](https://getsharex.com/docs/dev-builds).

* Upgraded .NET Framework to version [4.7.2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies#net-framework-472). If 4.7.2 or newer version of .NET Framework is not installed on system then it will be installed automatically by the ShareX installer

* Added image alignment option to image combiner tool
* Added experimental `UseAlternativeClipboardCopyImage` option to ["Application settings window -> Advanced tab"](https://twitter.com/ShareX/status/1295347012775358465) which copies images to clipboard with these formats to let supported applications to read image with transparency and file name info:

* Removed apply theme button as theme changes will now be applied automatically
* Removed experimental custom theme check box, so now it is always enabled if custom theme is enabled
* Improvements to settings save/load system to avoid unexpected setting resets:
    * When settings are saved to file, it is stored in [Windows hard disk cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-caching), so when electricity is lost or PC is not shutdown properly while settings are already in hard disk cache then this was causing the latest settings file and backup of previous settings file to be corrupted, whereas now ShareX bypasses hard disk cache while saving settings and copying backups to avoid this issue
    *Added two more fallback options when loading settings: temp and last weekly backup file. So if the latest and previous setting files somehow manage to become corrupt then as a last resort ShareX will load the last weekly backup of the settings file. New settings load fallback order is:
        * Latest setting file: `Documents\ShareX\ApplicationConfig.json`
        * Temp latest setting file: `Documents\ShareX\ApplicationConfig.json.temp`
        * Backup of previous setting file: `Documents\ShareX\Backup\ApplicationConfig.json`
        * Last weekly backup file: `Documents\ShareX\Backup\ApplicationConfig-2020-05-W22.json`
* Uploader passwords are now encrypted using [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API) while saving settings
    * **Important:** If you would like to backup your settings then use "Application settings window -> Settings tab -> Export button" instead of copying `Documents\ShareX` folder, otherwise you may have problems with encrypted passwords
* Improvements to gradient maker window which is mainly used for image effects:
    * Added gradient presets list[*](https://twitter.com/ShareX/status/1288114777181437956)
    * Allow creating gradient even when start (0%) and end (100%) gradient stop is missing
    * Gradient stops will be automatically ordered by location
    * Added "Reverse" button to be able to reverse locations of gradient stops
    * Show colors as icon in gradient stop list which also helps seeing transparent colors because of checkered background
* Image effect related changes:
    * Redesigned image effects window
    * Register `.sxie` extension for ShareX image effects
    * Added `-ImageEffect "filePath"` CLI command, which is what `.sxie` extension use
    * Added image effect packager ("Packager" button in image effects window), which lets you create `.sxie` files. Advantage of packager compared to previous `.json` export is package can contain image files required for image effect to function, but also ease of importing image effects for users which is just double clicking `.sxie` file[*](https://twitter.com/ShareX/status/1289192041398726659)
        * You can check out the examples in the #image-effects channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ShareX) or show your image effects to us[*](https://twitter.com/ShareX/status/1300199776126996481)
    * Added "ImageEffects" folder to ShareX personal folder
    * Added `%ShareXImageEffects%` path variable which will be used in all image effects which requires file or folder path, so when you supply path which is inside ShareX image effects folder then that section of the path will be automatically replaced with `%ShareXImageEffects%`. Reason for this is, if you share image effect to another user and if that users image effects folder is in custom location then path will still match correctly. Image effect packager also making sure that you can't select assets folder outside of ShareX image effects folder to make sure that paths will match correctly
    * Added interpolation mode option to "Image" (previously called "Image watermark") image effect, for example `Nearest neighbor` is handy when you want to make image border with 1px length image and extend it to fill whole image length, without this option extended image was looking blurry because of anti aliasing while drawing enlarged image
    * Added compositing mode option to "Image" image effect, for example `Source copy` option is handy when you want to draw image border corner which is rounded and contains transparency, those transparent pixels will be drawn directly without blending with image underneath that way you can make sure corners are transparent
    * Added opacity option to "Image" image effect
    * Added size aspect ratio support to "Image" image effect when `0` is used for width or height

    * "Use dark theme" option only enables dark mode in main window and tray menu. If you would like all windows to use dark theme then check "Experimental dark theme" option in application settings window. The reason why we decided not to enable this option by default is because this option works by changing color properties of each control to dark theme colors but most controls in [Windows Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms) look bad when their color properties are changed or do not completely support changing the control colors
* Added dark title bar support for Windows 10 17763 or higher <a class="badge" href="https://github.com/sylveon"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>sylveon</a>

* Added [Zero Width Shortener](https://zws.im) URL shortener

* Support custom uploader syntax in FTP URL path

* Added option to disable hotkeys when active window is fullscreen (Application settings window -> Advanced tab -> DisableHotkeysOnFullscreen)
* Show balloon tip warning when application settings fail to save (Main reason we added this notification was because anti-virus software or the [controlled folder access](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4046851/windows-10-allow-blocked-app-windows-security) feature in Windows 10 tend to block ShareX from saving settings without users being aware)
