            <h1>Object-Based Editing</h1>
            <p class="lead">Unlike traditional paint tools that bake changes into the image, XerahS Editor treats every annotation as a separate object on its own layer.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">Powerful Flexibility</h2>
            <p>This non-destructive approach gives you complete control over your screenshots:</p>

            <div class="row mt-4">
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Movable Objects</h3>
                    <p>Every arrow, text box, or shape is an independent object. You can select, move, resize, or delete them at any time—even after you've drawn other things on top.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Non-Destructive</h3>
                    <p>Because the original image remains untouched underneath, you can accidentally cover important details with an annotation and simply move it later to reveal them again.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-sort-amount-up"></i> Z-Ordering</h3>
                    <p>Bring important annotations to the front or send background elements to the back. Layer management ensures your visual hierarchy is exactly how you want it.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Re-Edit Capability</h2>
            <p>Did you make a typo in a text box? Need to change the color of an arrow? With multi-layer support, you just click the object and change its properties. No need to undo and redraw.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-success mt-4">
                <strong><i class="fas fa-save"></i> Project Saving:</strong> You can even save your work as a project file to come back and edit the text or layers days later.
